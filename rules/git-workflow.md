# Git Workflow Checklist

Before pushing:
- Review full diff against base branch.
- Summarize changes and list tests run or omitted.
- Use clear, conventional commit messages when possible.

For larger changes:
- Plan first; break work into reviewable steps.
- Prefer small, focused commits over one large commit.
