# Coding Style Checklist (Language-Agnostic)

- Keep functions small and focused; avoid deep nesting.
- Prefer pure functions and explicit data flow over mutation where practical.
- Name things clearly; avoid ambiguous abbreviations.
- Handle errors intentionally; avoid silent failures.
- Remove debug logging before finishing.
