# Testing Checklist (Language-Agnostic)

When tests exist or are expected:
- Prefer test-first for new behavior; keep tests close to requirements.
- Cover unit, integration, and end-to-end flows where applicable.
- Ensure failure messages are actionable; avoid brittle tests.

When tests are not run:
- Say why and suggest how to run or what to verify manually.
