# Planning Workflow

Use this for design and planning requests. Keep plans concise, ordered, and aligned with repo context.

## Steps

1. Clarify goals, constraints, and success criteria. Ask for missing details.
2. Skim relevant repo docs and code to ground assumptions.
3. Propose an ordered plan with concrete steps and impacted areas.
4. Call out risks, alternatives, and decisions needed from the user.
5. Include a test/verification plan and note any docs to update.
6. Ask for approval before implementation.

## Reminders

- Stay language-agnostic unless the repo dictates otherwise.
- In the test plan, include running any tests you write or change.
- Use `/rules/*.md` checklists for security, testing, and git hygiene.
